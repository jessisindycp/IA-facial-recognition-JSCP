Facial recognition using IA


# Project Title

Facial recognition using artificial intelligence

## Summary

Facial recognition using artificial intelligence to detect if a person is a human, object, animal, and if the person is registered in the database


## Background

AI facial recognition can help:
- Recognize if someone uploads a fake photo instead of their profile picture
- Identify if it's the person being sought or someone else.


## How is it used?

It can be used by means of cameras or systems.


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
Based on the Elements of AI course, I realized it could be adapted to image recognition, which sparked my curiosity. I searched for information to see if there were libraries for Angular and started experimenting.

## Challenges

My idea could be implemented as an employee registration system using facial recognition. The challenge would be requiring at least five photos of each employee and uploading them to the database for more accurate recognition.

## What next?

My project currently lacks a database connection. The next step would be to link it and maintain records there.
